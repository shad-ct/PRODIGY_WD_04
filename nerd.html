               <i> Wind blowing through her hairs</i>. Her hair wasn't that long, had cut it some days ago. With the song of wind and memories in her head she stood there alone. An empty bridge with no soul but her's alone. She covered her blue eyes with her bare hands from the evening sun . In a sudden, a memory flashed in her head, with her friends laughing and talking at the same spot of the bridge. She was scared to stand at the edge of the bridge , her friends made fun of it. "Look at me now" she screamed. She screamed again so that the God would hear her, thinking God would show some mercy on her. She… she jumped, she fell like a leaf falling from the it's mother tree. She heard the song again, song of the wind. They sung " to hell or to heaven, this world is full of suffer ".
                Her black and blue body smashed the water like an asteroid hitting the earth. Her body touched the cold water, she didn't felt anything, how could she? She was numb.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Meter 1 :</strong> she came out of her mother's womb, she heard the grey eyed nurse's laughter and mom's happiness and felt the warmth of her mother's hand for the first time.
                <br><strong>Meter 2 :</strong> A lot of unfamiliar faces, some looked so curious, some happy, some confused, "what am I suppose to do" she worried.
                <br><strong>Meter 3 :</strong> Cried for her mother's attention and time, she gave up with no gain. Felt pain for the first time.
                <br><strong>Meter 4 :</strong> She spelled her first word "mom" she saw happiness in her dad's red puffy face. That smile, their happiness, their joy. She smiled. 
                <br><strong>Meter 5 :</strong> She made a friend, her first friend, a cute white cat furred like a cloud.   Named Fluffy. Playing with Fluffy was the only thing she had left to do. 
                <br><strong>Meter 6 : </strong> Again she saw a lot of strange faces. Some crying some looked so sad, others are black and blue. She went looking for her dad. He was laying down. "I am going to wake him up" she thought. But she saw her mom crying near her dad's body. She tried to wake him up but he didn't, how will he? She didn't understood what's happening . Some men came and took his body away, she cried , again and again, until she fell asleep in the cold floor.
                <br><strong>Meter 7 :</strong> She went to school, it was hard for her. Bullies, strange faces… she learnt to read.
                <br><strong> Meter 8 :</strong> She completed her 50th book, she fell in love with books. She escaped the reality with the help of books, ran away from those strange faces, fake ones, from this world.
                <br><strong>Meter 9 :</strong> She made her first human friend, Julia. Julia with a brown eyes and a pony tail hair. She was the popular girl of the school. They talked , laughed, lied. 
                <br><strong>Meter 10 :</strong> Her first fake friend , Julia. She realized that she was being used by Julia. She cried a loud none was there for her. She wished for her dad's comfort but he won't come back. Wished for his friendly smile, warmth of his hands, his kiss, his hug.
                <br><strong>Meter 11 :</strong> She is in class 6th grade now, feeling all grown up. She spent her free time reading , she wasn't like other kids, she just stays home and reads books. death of Fluffy made her even more depressed, Fluffy was her only friend. She didn't cried, she just dissolved her pain inside her , like a salt dissolved in water.
                <br><strong>Meter 12 :</strong> like always faking a smile in her face. She helped her mom with household works. She saw her happiness, she wished to open up and tell everything to her mom, but something held her back. Something weighed her down. She didn't want to  make her mom sad again. She just wanted to keep that smile of her. 
                <br><strong> Meter 13 :</strong> She changed her school. She thought everything would change. Her life, her thoughts and everything. She tried her best to have a fresh start. She put on that fake smiling mask and tried to make friends , she succeeded . She made 3 new friends, she became friendly with everyone. She felt that wind of new life blowing through her hair, sucking the air in through her mouth, feeling so happy.
                <br><strong> Meter 14 :</strong> Walking alone, it was a chilling evening. A young man of age 30 was staring at her, he looked at her body with that crooked eyes, her beautiful blue eyes he grabbed her hands and raped her. She felt his hands all over her body. She was helpless, her mind wondered what to do, nothing helped her, no one did. She couldn't scream couldn't cry just felt numb. He let her go. She acted everything was just fine, put her fake mask and smiled that fake smile
                <br><strong> Meter 15 :</strong> She fell in love, "seduced by a teacher" would be much better, she thought its all real. In her little world no one showed kindness to her, but that one guy did. They fell in love, no she did, only she did. She didn't realized he was using her. He… he got rid of her after using her well enough. She was numb again nothing to feel. Everything felt against her. She thought to ask him "why me?" , how could she stand him?.
                <br><strong> Meter 16 :</strong> Her 3 new friends started being busy , acting to be busy ?. She felt so lonely, she never felt that much lonely before. 
                <br>Her lungs started to fill up with water she saw something , something staring at her . That thing took her to the shore, she was unconscious, she woke up in a hospital. Her mom crying , her 3 best friends looking so pale. There is something or someone took her attention away, it was that same thing that she saw underwater, the one who saved her life. That thing doesn't looks like a human , but looked more like a fog or something like a ghost . That thing came near her and said "Don't scream or say something to me, if they hears, they will think you gone crazy, lets take it slowly". With a smile on her face she nodded. After 2 days she got discharged. She didn't spoke a word to anyone, she went straight to her room, that figure followed her. She asked "who are you? , what are you? Why did you saved me? Why me? Why would you do that?" and a hundred more questions, the figure listened her till she was done with it . Figure said "My name is Reggie , you can call me Reg. what's your name?" she said in a calm voice "I am Catherine" Reggie said "I am kind of like a ghost, but not a ghost like in a horror movie" Catherine chuckled and asked "why did you saved me?" Reggie said "I don't know, I always sees you sitting there alone. I loved your poems, the way you talks to yourself . By the way why did you cut that hair?" Catherine said in a sad voice "my hair?, I just wanted to be normal like my other friends."
                <br>There was a long silence. She didn't spoke a thing nor he.
                <br>She asked "so.." he interrupted "wow, your room is filled with books! , do you reads a lot?" she said with a soft smile which she lost a long ago "yes, reading is my escape to another world ".
                
                <br><br>
                <i>
                Its was a summer break, </i>the warm rays of sun touched her soft cheeks. She opened her blue eyes softly and thought that if she could restart everything. Reggie said in a loud voice "Yo, morning Cathe!" Catherine waved and said "Morning Reg!, by the way I have a lot of questions for you, you should answer all of it!, wont you?" Reggie said "oh boy, alright ask me" she took a deep breathe and started with :
                Who are you? Why are you here? What are you? Why did you save me? Tell me all about you!
                Reg took a deep breathe and kept a little silence, and said "okay, I will tell you my story" and he started 
                "first of all, I was just like you, no , much worse I guess . And yeah I am actually dead, I was a human ah! I just did what you tried to do , suicide I mean.  This is kind of like a curse, you know? "All the pain that I felt, now there's nothing left" you wrote it right? I heard it over the bridge when you said that loud. And you know what? Whenever I saw you cry I really wished to talk to you But how can a ghost like me do that? 
                "He stared at her beautiful blue eyes and said "what do you want to know next?" she said "so are you going to be with me forever?" he sighed and said "nope, not forever . One day I have to leave".
                <i>In the evening ,</i> she went out to the bridge. Thought about her life and how dump she was to jump off the bridge. Reg said "you should probably change your perspective. This way you are, its quite weird. I will help you to change. I was just like you, so relatable. Lets give life a second chance, shall we?" Catherine said "Aight, fine! Whatever. You have my word " silence took over again, it was a chilling evening they just stood there staring at the sun dipping into ocean.
                <br>
               <i>Next morning,</i>  As usual Reggie woke her up, with his loud sweet voice she woke. He asked to show him around and she agreed . Busy road with vehicles moving in the speed of light, there was an old women trying to cross the road, as she always did, she took her path and ignored that old women. Reggie shouted "what are you doing?! Didn't you see that old women? Why aren't you helping her? Are you just like other ? With no kind heart !! You promised me !" Catherine shook her head down and said "I don't know! I cant ! I am too afraid , what if she doesn't like it?" "just do it ! She needs help so do it" said Reggie, as he said she did. Old women thanked her with a sweet toothless smile . Catherine felt happy, she had never felt this strange new feeling, she asked Reggie about it he said "this is it! See? This is called happiness you should change your perspective " "yeah it felt so good , you are right. Whatever thanks " said Catherine.
